In this article, we discussed the use of Shared Libraries and automated deployment to Google Play to make the CI/CD processes of Flutter applications more efficient and effective.

The usage of Jenkinsfile and Shared Library simplifies and optimizes the CI/CD processes of the project. Each stage, from code checkout to deploying the application to Google Play after running tests, represents a critical step in the software development life cycle. The use of custom libraries promotes modularity and reusability, fostering an efficient and streamlined development process.
